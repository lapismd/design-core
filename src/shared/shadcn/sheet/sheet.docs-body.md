### Size

You can adjust the size of the sheet using CSS classes:

```html
<Sheet.Root>
  <Sheet.Trigger>Open</Sheet.Trigger>
  <Sheet.Content class="w-[400px] sm:w-[540px]">
    <Sheet.Header>
      <Sheet.Title>Are you absolutely sure?</Sheet.Title>
      <Sheet.Description>
        This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete your account
        and remove your data from our servers.
      </Sheet.Description>
    </Sheet.Header>
  </Sheet.Content>
</Sheet.Root>
