# Shadcn / Layout

Layout primitives establish reusable spatial, scrolling, and responsive composition without application-domain policy.

## Public surface coverage

| Surface       | Public boundary                             | Requirement |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Card          | `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/card`          | DC-SHA-035  |
| Column Canvas | `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/column-canvas` | DC-SHA-036  |
| Resizable     | `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/resizable`     | DC-SHA-037  |
| Scroll Area   | `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/scroll-area`   | DC-SHA-038  |
| Separator     | `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/separator`     | DC-SHA-039  |
| Sidebar       | `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/sidebar`       | DC-SHA-040  |

## DC-SHA-034 — Shared Shadcn invariants

**Requirement.** Shadcn families MUST retain upstream semantic composition while using Design Core tokens, provenance metadata, and accessible focus behavior.

### Acceptance details

- Multipart primitives must remain importable as one family.
- Owned source must preserve `data-slot` and Design Core provenance metadata where generated.

## DC-SHA-035 — Card

**Requirement.** The Card family MUST compose related header, content, footer, media, title, description, and action regions.

### Acceptance details

- The public boundary is `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/card`.
- The catalog MUST demonstrate the family’s supported states without introducing a second runtime contract.

## DC-SHA-036 — Column Canvas

**Requirement.** The Column Canvas family MUST lay out horizontally scrollable columns with consumer-owned items and responsive sizing.

### Acceptance details

- The public boundary is `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/column-canvas`.
- Controller updates must preserve consumer item identity while columns resize or reflow.
- Header actions must use public hover tokens whose default remains visually distinct from the column surface.
- The catalog MUST demonstrate the family’s supported states without introducing a second runtime contract.

## DC-SHA-037 — Resizable

**Requirement.** The Resizable family MUST compose keyboard-accessible resizable panels and handles with documented orientation.

### Acceptance details

- The public boundary is `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/resizable`.
- The catalog MUST demonstrate the family’s supported states without introducing a second runtime contract.

## DC-SHA-038 — Scroll Area

**Requirement.** The Scroll Area family MUST provide styled viewport and scrollbar parts while preserving native scrolling semantics.

### Acceptance details

- The public boundary is `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/scroll-area`.
- The catalog MUST demonstrate the family’s supported states without introducing a second runtime contract.

## DC-SHA-039 — Separator

**Requirement.** The Separator family MUST render semantic or decorative separation in horizontal and vertical orientations.

### Acceptance details

- The public boundary is `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/separator`.
- The catalog MUST demonstrate the family’s supported states without introducing a second runtime contract.

## DC-SHA-040 — Sidebar

**Requirement.** The Sidebar family MUST compose responsive navigation rails, content groups, menus, toggles, and controlled open state.

### Acceptance details

- The public boundary is `@lapismd/design-core/shadcn/sidebar`.
- The catalog MUST demonstrate the family’s supported states without introducing a second runtime contract.
